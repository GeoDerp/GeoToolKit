# Feature Specification: Automated Malicious Code Scanner

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-comprehensive-automated`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17 
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a comprehensive, automated workflow script that can pull and scan a list of open-source projects (supporting all major programming languages) for malicious code using (SAST) and dynamic code analysis (DAST). The workflow is open-source and free to implement (MIT license). All dynamic tests to be conducted in a virtualized or containerized sandbox environment (that is automatically spun up and down). Finally, the workflow must generate a pritty report summarizing the findings."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security auditor, I want to provide a list of open-source projects and receive a report detailing any potential malicious code found within them, so that I can quickly assess the security risk of using these projects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a list of public repository URLs, **When** I run the workflow, **Then** the system clones each repository, runs SAST and DAST scans, and generates a consolidated report.
2. **Given** a running scan, **When** the dynamic analysis is performed, **Then** it is executed in an isolated sandbox environment that is automatically created and destroyed.
3. **Given** the workflow has completed, **When** I view the output, **Then** a well-formatted report summarizing findings for all scanned projects is available.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a repository from the list is private or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle projects with unsupported programming languages?
- What is the behavior if a sandbox environment fails to spin up or tear down?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a list of open-source project identifiers (e.g., repository URLs).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support scanning projects from major programming languages. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific languages are considered "major"?]
- **FR-003**: The system MUST perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST) on the source code.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) on the running application.
- **FR-005**: All dynamic tests MUST be executed within a temporary, isolated sandbox environment (e.g., container or VM).
- **FR-006**: The sandbox environment MUST be automatically created before the DAST scan and destroyed after.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST generate a consolidated report summarizing the findings from all scans.
- **FR-008**: The report MUST be "pritty" (well-formatted and easy to read). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What format should the report be in? (e.g., HTML, PDF, Markdown)]
- **FR-009**: The entire workflow script and its components MUST be licensed under the MIT license.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents an open-source project to be scanned. Key attributes: URL, name, programming language.
- **ScanResult**: Represents the outcome of a SAST or DAST scan for a specific project. Key attributes: findings, severity levels, file locations.
- **Report**: Represents the final output summarizing the scan results for all projects.
