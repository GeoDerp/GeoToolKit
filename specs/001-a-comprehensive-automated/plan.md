# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Comprehensive, offline-capable security scanning workflow orchestrating SAST (Semgrep), SCA (Trivy, OSV-Scanner), and DAST (OWASP ZAP) in isolated Podman containers, ingesting a list of Git repositories and producing a consolidated Markdown report.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All gates satisfied for this implementation phase; containers run rootless, network-restricted, and with seccomp profiles. No violations identified.

## Requirements Coverage (Traceability)
- FR-001 Input list: `src/main.py` (projects.json loader) and examples in README/quickstart
- FR-002 Multi-language: `.semgrep.yml` includes Python, JS/TS, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP
- FR-003 SAST: `SemgrepRunner`
- FR-004 DAST: `ZapRunner`
- FR-005 Sandbox: All runners use Podman with network/permissions isolation
- FR-006 Lifecycle: Runners create/destroy containers; `Workflow` manages temp dirs
- FR-007 Consolidated report: `src/reporting/report.py` with template
- FR-008 Pretty report: Markdown template `templates/report.md`
- FR-009 MIT license: `LICENSE`

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## 1. Technical Context *(mandatory)*
<!-- 
- **Source**: $ARGUMENTS
- **Action**: Integrate user-provided technical details here.
- **Purpose**: To ground the plan in the user's specific technical constraints and preferences.
-->
A self-contained, offline software assurance toolkit designed to run on a Linux host (e.g., Fedora/Opensuse). The workflow ingests a list of open-source Git repositories for a two-phase analysis.

**Phase 1: Static Analysis**
- Orchestrate a suite of open-source static analysis (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools, with each tool running in a dedicated, rootless Podman container.
- **Tools**:
    - **Semgrep**: For customizable code pattern analysis.
    - **Aqua Security's Trivy**: For broad dependency and secret scanning.
    - **Google's OSV-Scanner**: For precise vulnerability mapping against known advisories.

**Phase 2: Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**
- **Tool**: OWASP ZAP.
- **Environment**: Secure, rootless Podman sandbox.
- **Sandbox Configuration**:
    - Maximum isolation by default with restrictive seccomp profiles.
    - `--network=none` configuration.
    - User-configurable, private, host-only network bridges to monitor for anomalous outbound connection attempts.
    - Clearly defined mechanism for the user to specify a strict allow-list of ports and protocols for this internal monitoring.

**Operational Constraints**:
- The entire process must operate without external network connectivity.

**Output**:
- A consolidated, structured report that details all findings.
- Assigns a clear risk level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Maps discovered vulnerabilities to globally recognized compliance frameworks like NIST, ISM, or OWASP Top 10.
- Use only open-source, highly recommended tools.
