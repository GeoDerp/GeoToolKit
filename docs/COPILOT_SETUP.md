# GitHub Copilot Setup Guide for GeoToolKit

This guide helps you set up GitHub Copilot for optimal development experience with the GeoToolKit security scanner project.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Copilot Subscription**: Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription
2. **VSCode**: Install Visual Studio Code if not already installed
3. **Git Authentication**: Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub

## Quick Setup

### Method 1: Open in VSCode (Recommended)

1. Open this project in VSCode
2. When prompted, install the recommended extensions (this includes GitHub Copilot)
3. Sign in to GitHub Copilot when prompted
4. Start coding with AI assistance!

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Install GitHub Copilot extensions:
   - [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
   - [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)

2. Sign in to GitHub Copilot:
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "GitHub Copilot: Sign In"
   - Follow the authentication flow

3. Verify setup:
   - Open any Python file in `src/`
   - Start typing a function - you should see Copilot suggestions

## Using GitHub Copilot with GeoToolKit

### Code Completion

GitHub Copilot will provide intelligent code suggestions as you type, particularly helpful for:

- **Security scanning logic**: Copilot understands security patterns and can suggest appropriate checks
- **Python FastAPI endpoints**: Get suggestions for API route implementations
- **Error handling**: Proper exception handling patterns for security tools
- **Test cases**: Generate comprehensive test scenarios

### Copilot Chat

Use `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Shift+I`) to open Copilot Chat for:

- **Code explanations**: Ask about complex security scanning logic
- **Refactoring suggestions**: "How can I improve this scanner implementation?"
- **Documentation**: "Generate documentation for this security function"
- **Debugging**: "Why might this container scanner be failing?"

### Example Prompts for GeoToolKit Development

```
# In Copilot Chat:
"Generate a new security scanner runner for ESLint that follows the existing pattern in src/orchestration/runners/"

"Add comprehensive error handling to this Podman container execution"

"Create pytest fixtures for testing security scan results"

"Explain the security implications of this container configuration"
```

### Project-Specific Features

The project includes special configuration for enhanced Copilot experience:

- **Security-focused suggestions**: Copilot is configured to prioritize secure coding patterns
- **Container security**: Better suggestions for Podman/Docker security configurations  
- **Python FastAPI**: Optimized for web API development patterns
- **Testing patterns**: Enhanced suggestions for pytest-based security testing

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot not providing suggestions?

1. Check you're signed in: Look for Copilot icon in VSCode status bar
2. Verify file types: Ensure `.py`, `.json`, `.yml` files have Copilot enabled
3. Check settings: Open VSCode settings and search for "copilot"

### Getting generic suggestions instead of security-focused ones?

1. Open the project workspace file: `geotoolkit.code-workspace`
2. Ensure you're working within the project context
3. Reference the copilot instructions: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` provides project context

### Chat not understanding project context?

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Copilot Chat extension
2. Try opening a few key project files to give Copilot more context
3. Reference specific files in your chat prompts: "Looking at src/main.py, how can I..."

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "write a function", say "write a Python function to parse Trivy security scan results"

2. **Use project terminology**: Reference "containers", "security scanners", "SAST", "SCA", "DAST" in your prompts

3. **Security-first**: Always ask Copilot to consider security implications in its suggestions

4. **Test-driven**: Ask for test cases along with implementation code

5. **Documentation**: Request docstrings and comments that explain security considerations
